# Project Base for Vaadin and Spring Boot

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

The best way to create your own project based on this starter is [start.vaadin.com](https://start.vaadin.com/) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

## Running the Application

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project.

Run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If you want to run the application locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.

To run Integration Tests, execute `mvn verify -Pintegration-tests`.
